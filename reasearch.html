        <h2>Research Interests:</h2>
        <p>I am deeply dedicated to the field of Life Sciences, with a broad interest spanning various areas of study. My particular areas of focus include Genetics, Molecular Biology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Insect Pest Management, Integrated Pest Management, and Disease Ecology.</p>
        <h2>Undergrade Research:</h2>
        <p>During my B.Sc. dissertation, I focused on insect behavior, specifically examining the color attraction and fabric preference of *Culex quinquefasciatus* and *Aedes albopictus*. My research aimed to investigate the color preferences of these mosquitoes to contribute to developing strategies for avoiding mosquito bites.</p>

        <h2>Graduate Research:</h2>
        <p>I have finished my M.Sc. in Entomology, though my final results are yet to be published. On May 26, 2024, I successfully defended my thesis titled "Study on Tephritidis Fruit Fly (Diptera:Tephritidae) from Different Regions of Bangladesh" under the joint supervision of Professor Dr. Kabirul Bashar, Department of Zoology, Jahangirnagar University (JU), Savar and Dr. Md. Hasanuzzaman, Principal Scientific Officer, Cytology and Biocontrol Research (CBR), Radiation Entomology and Acarology Division (READ), Institute of Food and Radiation Biology (IFRB), Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission .In parallel to my thesis work I have published a conference paper in the title “Host record of tephritids fruit fly ( Tephritidae:Diptera) from Savar regions of Bangladesh” as a first author in 23rd International Biennial conference and AGM -2023. 
            In my thesis work, I extensively surveyed the fields, collected samples, and monitored the population of insect pests. I have dedicated this period to further broadening my understanding of the insect-host plant interaction and how environmental changes and various ecological factors can affect their distribution and behavior, as well as their relationships with other species.
            Throughout my fieldwork, I also had the opportunity to engage with farmers directly, which provided me with firsthand knowledge of their approaches to pest management. These interactions are very meaningful to me since I have a personal connection to farming. Owing to my family's long agricultural background and the fact that I grew up in a village near the town, I have always had a deep affinity for farmers and a deep understanding of their challenges and the need to manage insect pests.
            During my M.Sc. thesis research, I also gained instructive laboratory experience, particularly in identifying fruit fly species via a stereo zoom microscope, mass rearing fruit flies, studying their life cycles, and measuring infestation indices at the Cytology and Biocontrol Research (CBR), Radiation Entomology and Acarology Division (READ), Institute of Food and Radiation Biology (IFRB), Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE), Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission. I gained a terrafic opportunity to interact with a few of our country's renowned scientists by getting associated with these laboratories. It definitely improved my overall technical competence and taught me how to adjust well to a lab setting and follow lab procedures. This helped me develop qualities essential to conducting tedious research, which is a very important part of obtaining graduate degrees. The practical experience I have gained in these environments has significantly trained me to overcome the difficulties of graduate-level research.
