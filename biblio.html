        <h2>I am Md. Sanowar Hossain, born and raised in a middle-class family in the small town of Saidpur, located in a southern province of our country. My primary and secondary education was completed at Al Faruque Academy, Saidpur. For my higher education, I attended Lions School and College, Saidpur.</h2>


            <h2>Since childhood, I dreamed of becoming a scientist, which inspired me to pursue my Secondary and Higher School Certificate examinations in the Science group. I gained admission to Jahangirnagar University through a highly competitive exam, in which more than 77,000 students participated. I secured the 204th position. My higher education journey began in the Department of Zoology at Jahangirnagar University, where I had the privilege of interacting with renowned biologists during my B.Sc. and M.Sc. studies.</h2>
            
            <h2>A turning point in my life came when I started my undergraduate research under the supervision of Dr. Kabirul Bashar. During this period, I learned extensively and was appointed as a Research Assistant in his Entomology lab, participating in several projects.</h2> 
            
           <h2> During my M.Sc., I had the opportunity to work at the Atomic Energy Commission as a Research Fellow under the supervision of Dr. Hasanuzzaman, Principal Scientific Officer. This experience provided me with valuable knowledge and the protocols necessary to work in a world-class laboratory.</h2>
            
            <h2>I am now seeking a Ph.D. opportunity to further enhance my knowledge in Life Sciences.</h2>
